# Bubble-Sort
Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high.Bubble sort works on the repeatedly swapping of adjacent elements until they are not in the intended order. It is called bubble sort because the movement of array elements is just like the movement of air bubbles in the water. Bubbles in water rise up to the surface; similarly, the array elements in bubble sort move to the end in each iteration.
# Algorithm
begin BubbleSort(arr)  
   for all array elements  
      if arr[i] > arr[i+1]  
         swap(arr[i], arr[i+1])  
      end if  
   end for     
   return arr     
end BubbleSort
